# Cloth-Simulation
Using Hook's Law to simulate cloth dynamics

Very basic example, not much to it, with the exception that i used a basic avoidance check to create some control over its behavior.

It has control over the following factors:
- Format (size and spacing)
- Gravity
- Breaking force (improves realism)
- Randomizing strength (improves realism)
- Collisions (improves realism)
- Ripple effect (improves realism)
