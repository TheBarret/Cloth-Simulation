# Cloth-Simulation
Very basic implementation of Hook's Law to simulate cloth dynamics

Has control over the following factors:
- Format (size and spacing)
- Gravity
- Breaking force (improves realism)
- Randomizing strength (improves realism)
- Collisions (improves realism)
- Ripple effect (improves realism)
